And here's the review in English, for all you foreign people:<p>
<b>Per-Henrik Petterson</b> and <b>Tomas Amneskog</b> (rather famous Swedish synth-band
<b>Kiethevez</b>) took an afternoon off to listen to <b>Frilly Pink</b>.<br>
Heavy dancemusic is the name of the game.<br>
<b>P-HP:</b> Quite heavy, really, but the name's all wrong. Sounds like a glamrock-band.<br>
<b>TA:</b> I think this kind of instrumental music needs more life to be really good.
After a minute it feels like you've heard it all.<br>
<b>P-HP:</b> I would definitely have kept on listening after this song. I think it would work on an 
alternative dancefloor. I give it a 3.<br>
<b>TA:</b> The breaks were good, but there was no action. A little more imagination and
 it would have been OK, but now it gets a 2.<br>
<b>P-HP:</b> OK, a 2+.<br>
