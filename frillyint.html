<b>
I'm sitting in a small studio in northern Wales with the band that 
is a model to several young people. The name of the band? Frilly Pink ofcourse!<br>
How do you feel about beeing a rolemodel to young people?
</b>
<p>
<b>CC:</b> Piss off!<br>
<b>Steve:</b> We have the chance to lead them on to a better life, 
to give them something. But we dont!<br> 
<b>MC:</b> Yeah!<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Except for the girls. We give them a lot!<br>
<b>CC:</b> The fans are all bastards.<br>
<p>
<b>How did you react when the press hailed your new album Mano a Mano as
THE album of the century?</b><br>
<b>CC:</b> We told them to write that, or we'd break their legs.<br>
<b>Steve:</b> And they wrote it, so we broke their legs anyway.<br>
<p>
<b>Why?</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> Because we're totally unpredictable. Like, you didn't know I
was gonna do this to you.<br>
<p>
<b>Ow! You bastard! Let go of me!</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> OK.<br>
<p>
<b>Holy Jesus Christ! OK, tell the fans about a typical Frilly day.</b><br>
<b>CC:</b> We get drunk.<br>
<b>Steve:</b> Then we get out of bed, and go down to the studio.<br>
<b>Dave:</b> We write some autographs on the way, and grab something to eat.<br>
<b>Steve:</b> How many autographs has your mother got now CC?<br>
<b>CC:</b> Shut up you sissy!<br>
<b>MC:</b> Usually there are some kids in the studio when we get there, 
but CC fixes that.<br>
<b>CC:</b> Right, I hate kids. If they're not careful they could get ... lost.<br>
<p>
<b>What do you do in the studio? How do you get the inspiration for all those 
hits you've written?</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> We jam.<br>
<b>MC:</b> Yupp.<br>
<b>Dave:</b> And party.<br>
<b>Steve:</b> But mostly we just hang around in bars and write songs about
people who bother us.<br>
<p>
<b>So, basically you just go down to the pub, and
those wonderful songs come out?</b><br>
<b>CC:</b> Uh-hu.<br>
<p>
<b>OK, tell me a little about your latest tour to Germany.</b><br>
<b>MC:</b> It was brilliant! We played at this place in Berlin, and there was, 
like, almost a hundred people there!<br>
<p>
<b>By a hundred, I suppose you mean a hundred thousand?</b><br>
<b>MC:</b> No, a hundred people. All dressed in black and screaming and runing 
around like totally crazy!<br>
<p>
<b>Oh, you played one of Berlins famous underground arenas then?</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> Nope. It was a wedding we gatecrashed.<br>
<p>
<b>You are famous for your exciting stage performances. Tell me how
you got the idea for the last show here in Wales. The one where CC 
threw a knocked out policeman into the crowd. That was a brilliant 
stunt, and really showed how you denounce the whole British legal system.</b><br>
<b>CC:</b> Bastard's gonna hit me, right, so I had to defend myself, OK?<br>
<b>MC:</b> Pigs.<br>
<p>
<b>OK, is there anything else you'd like to tell your fans?</b><br>
<b>CC:</b> Sod off!<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Girls, you have my number!<br>
<b>MC:</b> The new single is out soon! Buy it!<br>
<b>Steve:</b> Rock on!<br>
<p>
<b>Thank you.</b><br>
