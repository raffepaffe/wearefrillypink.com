<b>A review by a grumpy old git:</b><p>
When I was young we had Elvis and Tommy Steele. Period. These guys are not the new Elvis.
Or Tommy Steele for that matter. I find their music incredibly stupid, they look stupid, 
they can't sing, play or write songs. I hate them.<p>
<b>A review by a young, cool reporter from a cool magazine:</b><p>
CC McNasty was at his most sensitive tonight. There is no one else who can shout "yeah!" 
as heartbreakingly beautiful as he does.<br>
Dave Helmet had a tough job, playing solo guitar, but 
he showed us all that he is almost as good as Steve Metal. When he did a stagedive with 
his guitar he also showed that he is a showman of the highest rank.<br>
MC Evil behind the synthesizer delivered his 
famous hysterical acid-sweeps with total precision.<br>
I believe that Frilly Pink is one of, if not THE, best livebands in the world today. 
Obviously the audience felt so too. They went totally crazy the moment the guys appeared on 
stage, and there were at least five people from the audience on stage, who wanted to touch 
their idols.

10/10 Frilly rocks the ass off all other bands!
