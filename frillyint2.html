<b>
Hi, I'm Lou Rodent, this is W.R.O. and with me today is one of the most
influential groups of this decade. Frilly pink. Right guys: I've got a bunch of letters from your fans here, and I thought I'd read 
them to you and you can reply to them straight away. Nice, huh?
</b>
<p>
<b>CC:</b> Bloody brilliant!<br>
<b>MC:</b> Yeah!<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Shoot, man, shoot!<br>
<b>Brixton:</b> Right, fan communication is very important. Shoot!<br>
<b>Stanley:</b> What's all this about shooting? Make love, not war. Peace.<br>
<p>
<b>OK. This one's from a girl called Loretta, and she wants to know if 
any of you have girlfriends. Well, do you?</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> Um, no, not exactly.<br>
<b>MC:</b> Well, er, haha.<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Who needs 'em anyway?<br>
<b>CC:</b> Yeah! Girls are all bastards!<br>
<b>Steve:</b> Sissies the lot of 'em!<br>
<b>Brixton:</b> Hey!<br>
<b>CC:</b> Not you. You're not a real girl.<br>
<b>Brixton:</b> Oh yeah?<br>
<b>Steve:</b> You're our manager. You're OK.<br>
<b>Brixton:</b> Oh, I feel so much better now, thank you very much.<br>
<p>
<b>Stanley?</b><br>
<b>Stanley:</b> I don't care much about earthly pleasures.<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Just wait 'til his wife hears he said that!<br>
<p>
<b>Er, right. Next question. This one's from Mark in Cornwall. He'd
like to know if you go to church regularly.</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> Church. Now that's an interesting concept.<br>
<b>CC:</b> God's a bastard.<br>
<b>Steve:</b> Hm, now that sounds like a new song. God's a bastard.
 You think they'd play it on MTV? 
<p>
<b>Here's one from Klaus in Germany. He wonders about your favourite 
food.</b><br>
<b>MC:</b> Food? Who cares about food. We live on beer and cheeze doodles.<br>
<b>Dave:</b> And the love from our female fans.<br>
<b>Brixton:</b> So that's why you're so thin?<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Shut up, you girlie.<br>
<b>Brixton:</b> Oooh! I'm so scared!<br>
<b>Stanley:</b> Easy now, kids. There's a lot of heavy vibes in this room.<br>
<b>CC:</b> What, you got malaria or something?<br>
<p>
<b>Um, Hilda in Austria wants to know if you can yodle. Now that's an 
interesting question. Steve?</b><br>
<b>Steve:</b> Yodle? Isn't that kind of like Chinese spaghetti?<br>
<b>MC:</b> Uh-hu.<br>
<b>CC:</b> No stupid, that's a noodle.<br>
<b>Steve:</b> Oh yeah? Well, eat this then Mr Know-it-all!<br>
<b>CC:</b> OW! You bastard!<br>
<p>
<b>Please, guys, relax. Let's take another letter, and calm down.
This time it's Chang from Hong Kong. He writes: Dear Frilly Pink...</b><br>
<b>CC:</b> Nice boy.<br>
<p>
<b>Shush! Dear Frilly Pink. I hate your music and you are the ugliest
band I've ever seen. I'd like to- OW! Hey, I didn't write this! It was
Chang! It was Chang! OW!</b><br>
<b>Stanley:</b> Hey CC, man, you shouldn't do that. It's bad for your karma.<br>
<b>CC:</b> Piss off!<br>
<p>
<b>Ow! Ow! Ow!</b><br>
