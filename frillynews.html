I've seen the new video for "Watch You Die" and it is just as hard as
 we hoped it would be. The guys have given me permission to put it on 
the page for promotional purposes only. It will be available shortly.

else in the known universe.<br>

this.<br> 
The video will contain some <B>previously unreleased live shots</B>,

effects</B>. Can't wait to see it!

The guys never showed up at their latest gig. There is a rumour that they 
had quite a party before the gig, with lots of <B>groupies and beer</B>, and 
that they got  <B>too drunk to play</B>.<br>
But this is only a rumour. When asked about the incident <B>Brixton</B> just 
said "Well, they're rockstars."

<b>971110:</b><br>
Will there be a new <B>Frilly</B> gig? The guys are working on it, but we 
don't know how it's going to work out. 
<B>Ben</B> is practicing his dancing, and the others are writing new 
material. How it's going to sound? I haven't got the foggiest idea!
<p>

<b>Steve Metal</b> has been released from the Betty Ford Clinic! Hooray! Our guitar god
 is back, angrier and faster than ever!<br>
<p>

<b>971028:</b><br>
<b>Ben McPetting</b> is now an official Frilly member! Since the guys found out 
he's a <b>brilliant dancer</b>, that's what he'll be doing on stage. It seems 
he's the master of something called <b>"Deutsches erotisches salsa"</b>, whatever 
that may be.<br>
<p>
<hr width=80>
<p>

<p>
<b>971001:</b><br>
The guys are considering to take up a new member: <A HREF="frillypix/mcpetting.jpg">Ben McPetting</A>. 
He's out on probation, so he's on a trial-period with the band. 
According to a newsletter from the band he'll be playing drums, 
bassguitar, or possibly congas. They haven't decided yet.<br>

Latest news: <b>Dave's guitar</b> is <b>not</b> broken!

The <b>gig in Gothenburg was a total success</b>! The crowd went wild when the guys appeared on 
stage, and then it just went crazier. At least four people from the audience were up on 
the stage, mingling with the band. <a href="frillypix/lubeck.jpg">One of them</a> picked up <b>CC McNasty</b> and started to carry 
him away, but luckily CC got free and returned to his position at the front of the band.
<p>
<b>Dave</b> lost his sunglasses during a stagedive, and his guitar broke. Rock 'n Roll!<p>
A rumour says that <b>a professor</b> was in the audience, and that he had got his hands on a 
backstage-pass to the party afterwards. <p>
<b>Steve</b> was not seen on stage and speculations started after the gig. Was he dead, 
or had he just been admitted to the <b>Betty Ford Clinic</b> again? We don't know, but when asked 
about it, the guys just said "no comment". Someone said that he had heard them talking to 
a guy called <b>McPetting</b>, and according to this usually trustworthy source, the guys are 
thinking about a replacement for Steve. We'll just have to see.

There is a new rumour that says the band will appear at a place in Gothenburg for 
their first ever gig in Sweden. The band is unavailable for comment, but when 
pressed Brixton doesn't deny it. So stay tuned friends. Updates on the gig will follow!

It seems there's been a rumour that Steve Metal was kicked from the band. This is totally 
untrue. He's on vacation, and will be back very soon. So, all you fans out there, your guitar-god will be back.<br>
Bigger and better than ever. 
<p>

<b>9705021:</b><br>
The single has been sent to the mastering plant, and will be revealed to the world at Studs, 
in Gothenburg, Sweden. Besides the radio edit and the Chemical Sisters mix, there's also a 
special hardcore version by famous German remixer Klaus Schnabelweber.<br>
The band is also about to release a limited edition Frilly T-shirt, which will be available shortly. <p>
<hr width=80>

<b>970505:</b><br>
The band has been in the studio and recorded their new single, called 
<b>"Conquest of Hell"</b>. It will be released as soon as the vocals are mastered.
The sinle will feature the Radio Version, and a special <b>Chemical Sisters</b> remix. 
According to Brixton the remix is guaranteed to be a big hit on dancefloors 
all over the world.

<b>970413:</b><br>
According to Brixton, the band's manager, the guys are about to go into 
the studio once again to finish their new album, <b>Conquest of Hell</b>.<br>
The new album will show a new side of Frilly Pink. They will (ofcourse) 
continue in their familiar style, but with a few new concepts.<br>
The music will be even harder (if at all possible) and Brixton promises
 us that Cc's lyrics will be more personal than ever. We might even get 
a ballad or two, which is about time. The album will be released any 
time now.

A rumour said that Frilly was to give a concert in Gothenburg, Sweden, 
and the place was full of anticipating fans, but unfortunately the 
band had to cancel at the last moment because Dave Helmet flew to London
 on one of his famous party-tours. The band promises to come back some
 other time though.
